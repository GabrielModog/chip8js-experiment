# Chip-8 Emulator 🕹️

An experimental Chip-8 emulator powered by Javascript.

## Getting Started

To run the project in your machine you have to be installed [Bun](https://bun.sh).

Or just run the `index.html` file in the `/public` folder with your own server solution.

#### Running

```bash
bun run server.js
```

## Goals

> Be able to emulate most of Chip-8 roms.
> Disassembly roms (maybe)
